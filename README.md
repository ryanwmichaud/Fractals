# Fractals

A real time fractal visualizer - draw a curve and see how it looks with each 'forward' segment replaced by itself! Or draw in real time at higher recursive depth!


W - Turn Up
A - Turn Left
S - Turn Down
D - Turn Right
P - Move Forward
Q - Turn Counterclockwise
E - Turn clockwise


All actions including turns are recorded into the directions but you can use the undo button to undo your last action
Note that turning 180 degrees turns you around clockwise - for more control you can use q and e to turn left and right
