            A real time fractal visualizer - draw a curve and see how it looks with each 'forward' segment replaced by itself! Or draw in real time at higher recursive depth!
        </p>
        <p class="controls">
                <br>    W - Turn Up
                <br>    A - Turn Left
                <br>    S - Turn Down
                <br>    D - Turn Right
                <br>    P - Move Forward
                <br>    Q - Turn Counterclockwise
                <br>    E - Turn clockwise
        
        </p>
        <p> 
            <br> All actions including turns are recorded into the directions but you can use the undo button to undo your last action
            <br> Note that turning 180 degrees turns you around clockwise - for more control you can use q and e to turn left and right 
            <br>
            <br> scalce - tells us how you want your curve to scale down. For example with a scale of 3, each line will be 3 times smaller than the previous iteration. A curve that ends 3 units from the starting point will stay the same size!
            <br> depth tells us how many times to replace each forward segment with the entire curve 
            <br> the direction string is a visual representation of the instructions for drawing the sdafasdgfb curve of the fractal. each f will be replaced with the entire formula
            <br> you can optionally edit or completly enter this string by hand - just hit the edit button to submit it!
        </p>

        <p class="controls">
                <br>    f - Go forward
                <br>    + - Turn clockwise
                <br>    - - Turn counter clockwise
        </p>
            
        <p>
            <br> way to draw with arrow or turn with arrows?
            <br> make turtle more readable with directions for the numbers like enum
            <br> replace ctx  wconstrext, rpleace +_ w rl?
            <br> undo - its the 180 degree turns! bc its ++!. maybe we need like a flag for 180 turns that tells us when to delete 2...
            <br> undo - same direction in a row - maybe add a placeholder in the states string to delete that doesnt actually cahnge
            <br> undo - undo more than there is 
            <br> undo - only cahnge state if we didnt delete an f! or add placeholder and always delete
            <br> textbox edititng super werid what?
            <br> draw a goal dot start and stop for dif subdivisions/scales to keep it same scale
